  <p class="description">A virtual reality headset is a heads-up display that allows users to interact with simulated environments
  and experience a first-person view.VR headsets replace the userâ€™s natural environment with virtual reality content, such as a movie, a game
   or a prerecorded 360-degree VR environment that allows the user to turn and look around, just as in the physical world.<p>
