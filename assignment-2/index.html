    <h1>Sao Paulo</h1>
    <img src="images/sao paulo.jpg" alt="Sao Paulo"/>
    <p>When I lived in Brazil, one of the places I enjoyed living
      in was Sao Paulo because I have a lot of memories from there
      and had plenty of relatives living around me and friends.<p>

      <h2>Brasli</h2>
      <img src="images/brasli.jpg" alt="Brasli"/>
      <p>This was another great place I lived at for a little bit but while I was
        there I had a great time getting to know new relatives.<p>


      <h3>Ubatuba</h3>
      <img src="images/ubatuba.jpg" alt="Ubatuba"/>
      <p>This place was by far one of the best places because so many great things
        happened when I was there. I was always getting myself in trouble with
        the security guard at the place I lived at tho.<p>


      <h4>Sao Jose Dos Campos</h4>
      <img src="images/sao jose dos campos.jpg" alt="Sao Jose Dos Campos"/>
      <p>A beautiful place to live but was there mainly because my dad had a job there
        for some time but I still had a great time there.<p>


      <h5>Rio De Janeiro</h5>
      <img src="images/rio de janeiro.jpg" alt="Rio De Janeiro"/>
      <p>Good place to go to the beach to because plenty of people enjoy being at the
        beach there and learning to surf is great as well there.<p>
